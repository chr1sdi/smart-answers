  To get a CNI, you must post notice of your intended marriage in <%= calculator.country_name_lowercase_prefix %>. You can do this at the British embassy or in front of a notary public.

  <%= render partial: "three_day_residency_requirement.govspeak.erb",
             locals: {
               country_name_lowercase_prefix: calculator.country_name_lowercase_prefix
             } %>

  <%= render partial: 'contact_method.govspeak.erb',
             locals: { calculator: calculator } %>

  You’ll need to provide supporting documents, including:

  - your passport
  - proof of residence, such as a residence certificate - check with the embassy or notary public to find out what you need
  - equivalent documents for your partner

  ^You’ll also need to provide evidence of nationality or residence if the divorce or dissolution took place outside the UK. You’ll need to get it [legalised](/get-document-legalised) and [translated](/government/collections/lists-of-translators-and-interpreters) if it’s not in English.^

  ###What happens next

  The embassy or notary public will charge a fee for taking the oath.

  If you give notice at a notary public, you must post the signed forms and any supporting documents to your nearest British embassy or consulate afterwards.

  ^The embassy or consulate may charge a fee to return your documents to you.^

  The consulate will display your notice of marriage publicly for 7 days.

  They’ll then send all of your documentation to the British embassy or consulate nearest to where you’re getting married in <%= calculator.country_name_lowercase_prefix %>, who will issue your CNI (as long as nobody has registered an objection).

  There’s an additional fee for this - the embassy or consulate will contact you to arrange payment.
