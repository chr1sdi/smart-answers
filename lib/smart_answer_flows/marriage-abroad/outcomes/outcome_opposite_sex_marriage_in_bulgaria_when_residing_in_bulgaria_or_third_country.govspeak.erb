  To get a CNI, you must post notice of your intended marriage in <%= calculator.country_name_lowercase_prefix %>. You can do this at the British embassy or in front of a notary public.

  CNIs issued in <%= calculator.country_name_lowercase_prefix %> are valid for 6 months.

             } %>

  The British embassy or notary public can take your oath or affirmation and witness your notice of marriage. The notary public may charge 2 separate fees for this.

  ## Get your documents witnessed in front of a notary public

  Download a [‘Certificate of no impediment application pack’](/government/publications/certificate-of-no-impediment-application-pack-bulgaria), fill in the forms and take them with you to a notary public.

  Once the notary public has witnessed your documents, send the original documents to the British embassy in Sofia:

  <% calculator.overseas_passports_embassies.each do |embassy| %>
    $A
    <%= embassy.title %>
    <%= embassy.address.label.value %>
    $A
  <% end %>

  ## Get your documents witnessed at the embassy

  [Make an appointment at the embassy in Sofia](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-embassy-sofia/notice-of-marriage-or-civil-partnership/slot_picker)

  <%= render partial: 'download_and_fill_notice_and_affidavit_but_not_sign.govspeak.erb' %>

  You’ll need to provide supporting documents, including:

  - your passport
  - proof of residence, such as a residence certificate or flight tickets - check with the embassy or notary public to find out what you need
  - equivalent documents for your partner

    ^Your partner will need to follow the same process and pay the fees to get their own CNI.^
  <% end %>

  <%= render partial: 'consular_cni_os_not_uk_resident_ceremony_not_germany.govspeak.erb' %>

  ^You’ll also need to provide evidence of nationality or residence if the divorce or dissolution took place outside the UK. You’ll need to get it [legalised](/get-document-legalised) and [translated](/government/collections/lists-of-translators-and-interpreters) if it’s not in English.^

  ###What happens next

  The consulate will display your notice of marriage publicly for 7 days before issuing your CNI.

  You can collect the CNI from the embassy or ask for it to be sent by courier to an address in Bulgaria. You’ll need to pay any courier fees.
